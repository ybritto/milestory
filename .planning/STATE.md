# STATE.md

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-04-03)

**Core value:** Milestory must make yearly goals feel concrete, measurable, and motivating by showing clear progress against a plan the user can actually follow.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — goal-planning-and-checkpoints

## Current Status

- Project initialized for Milestory
- Codebase map exists in `.planning/codebase/`
- Research synthesized in `.planning/research/`
- Requirements and roadmap created for the auth-free personal first release
- Phase 01 is complete with the auth-free backend status endpoint and the Milestory-branded frontend home screen
- Next planned work is Phase 02 goal planning and checkpoint flows on top of the routed frontend shell

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Foundation And Personal Mode | Complete |
| 2 | Goal Planning And Checkpoints | Complete |
| 3 | Progress Engine And Status | Pending |
| 4 | Dashboard And Motivational UX | Pending |

## Current Execution

- **Current phase:** 02
- **Completed plans:** `01-01`, `01-02`, `01-03`, `02-01`, `02-02`, `02-03`
- **Next plan:** `Phase 03 discussion`
- **Plan progress:** `3 / 3` (`100%`)

## Decisions

- Keep status assembly in a Spring-free use case and map generated DTOs only at the infrastructure edge.
- Use Spring Boot 4's explicit `spring-boot-liquibase` module so Liquibase baselines apply at runtime.
- Read the live database name from the datasource connection for truthful status reporting.
- Use same-origin generated API configuration so the frontend calls `/api/v1/status` directly without auth plumbing.
- Represent foundation status as explicit loading, ready, empty, and error signal states behind a dedicated frontend store.
- Keep the Phase 1 frontend to a single read-only Milestory home route with no auth or speculative feature scaffolding.
- Reserve dedicated archive and restore endpoints early so the goal lifecycle is contract-backed before controller implementation.
- Keep checkpoint previews cumulative and evenly paced across the planning year so every category shares one backend-owned planning model.
- Surface `GENERIC_FALLBACK` explicitly when category-specific planning logic is absent so later UX can explain that the user should refine the plan.
- Keep generated OpenAPI models at the controller boundary and translate them into application commands through MapStruct.
- Enforce archived goals as read-only backend state, with explicit `KEEP_EXISTING` and `REGENERATE` restore semantics.
- Preserve `BigDecimal` scale through the goal model so equality-based tests and serialized payloads stay stable.
- Reuse the same guided create/edit flow in the frontend so goal updates stay aligned with initial planning.
- Keep the frontend planning store backend-driven so preview, detail, archive, and restore state all come straight from API responses.
- Route `/goals/archive` ahead of the generic detail route so archive navigation cannot be captured by `:goalId`.

## Performance Metrics

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 01-foundation-and-personal-mode | 02 | 13 min | 2 | 15 |
| 01-foundation-and-personal-mode | 03 | 8 min | 2 | 13 |
| Phase 02 P01 | 39 min | 2 tasks | 16 files |
| Phase 02 P02 | 17 min | 2 tasks | 42 files |
| Phase 02 P03 | 14 min | 2 tasks | 21 files |

## Session

- **Stopped at:** Completed `02-03-PLAN.md`
- **Last summary:** `.planning/phases/02-goal-planning-and-checkpoints/02-03-SUMMARY.md`

## Notes

- Treat the current repository as a scaffolded brownfield, not an already-working application
- Authentication is explicitly deferred until after the first release
- Template leftovers remain in some docs and metadata and should stay visible during implementation decisions
