# STATE.md

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-04-03)

**Core value:** Milestory must make yearly goals feel concrete, measurable, and motivating by showing clear progress against a plan the user can actually follow.
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — dashboard-and-motivational-ux

## Current Status

- Project initialized for Milestory
- Codebase map exists in `.planning/codebase/`
- Research synthesized in `.planning/research/`
- Requirements and roadmap created for the auth-free personal first release
- Phase 01 is complete with the auth-free backend status endpoint and the Milestory-branded frontend home screen
- Phase 03 is now complete with persistent progress-entry writes, enriched read models, and the goal-detail progress-entry experience
- Phase 04 is complete with the dashboard shell, active-goals destination, and shared accomplishment-band treatment wired through the goal detail experience

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Foundation And Personal Mode | Complete |
| 2 | Goal Planning And Checkpoints | Complete |
| 3 | Progress Engine And Status | Complete |
| 4 | Dashboard And Motivational UX | Complete |

## Current Execution

- **Current phase:** 04
- **Completed plans:** `01-01`, `01-02`, `01-03`, `02-01`, `02-02`, `02-03`, `03-01`, `03-02`, `03-03`, `04-01`, `04-02`, `04-03`
- **Next plan:** none
- **Plan progress:** `3 / 3` (`100%`) for Phase 04

## Decisions

- Keep status assembly in a Spring-free use case and map generated DTOs only at the infrastructure edge.
- Use Spring Boot 4's explicit `spring-boot-liquibase` module so Liquibase baselines apply at runtime.
- Read the live database name from the datasource connection for truthful status reporting.
- Use same-origin generated API configuration so the frontend calls `/api/v1/status` directly without auth plumbing.
- Represent foundation status as explicit loading, ready, empty, and error signal states behind a dedicated frontend store.
- Keep the Phase 1 frontend to a single read-only Milestory home route with no auth or speculative feature scaffolding.
- Reserve dedicated archive and restore endpoints early so the goal lifecycle is contract-backed before controller implementation.
- Keep checkpoint previews cumulative and evenly paced across the planning year so every category shares one backend-owned planning model.
- Surface `GENERIC_FALLBACK` explicitly when category-specific planning logic is absent so later UX can explain that the user should refine the plan.
- Keep generated OpenAPI models at the controller boundary and translate them into application commands through MapStruct.
- Enforce archived goals as read-only backend state, with explicit `KEEP_EXISTING` and `REGENERATE` restore semantics.
- Preserve `BigDecimal` scale through the goal model so equality-based tests and serialized payloads stay stable.
- Reuse the same guided create/edit flow in the frontend so goal updates stay aligned with initial planning.
- Keep the frontend planning store backend-driven so preview, detail, archive, and restore state all come straight from API responses.
- Route `/goals/archive` ahead of the generic detail route so archive navigation cannot be captured by `:goalId`.
- [Phase 03]: Keep progress updates append-only and cumulative, with correction detection based on the latest entry by entryDate then recordedAt.
- [Phase 03]: Derive pace status from checkpoint interpolation on the backend with a named 5 percent of target tolerance constant.
- [Phase 03]: Keep user-facing pace summary and detail strings in the backend service so later UI work renders product-owned copy instead of recomputing tone.
- [Phase 03]: Keep progress updates append-only and cumulative, with correction detection based on the latest entry by entryDate then recordedAt.
- [Phase 03-progress-engine-and-status]: Assemble goal detail and list responses from application read models that pair persisted entries with backend-derived progress snapshots.
- [Phase 03-progress-engine-and-status]: Keep checkpoint context labels and detail copy backend-owned so the frontend renders annotations without rebuilding progress logic.
- [Phase 03]: Keep progress-entry success and correction messaging in the shared planning store so the detail route only renders backend outcome state.
- [Phase 03]: Use an in-route reactive-form overlay with explicit keyboard handling instead of route navigation or a dependency-heavy dialog library.
- [Phase 04-dashboard-and-motivational-ux]: Keep dashboard status interpretation backend-owned and limit frontend logic to presenter-level grouping and ordering.
- [Phase 04-dashboard-and-motivational-ux]: Centralize 80/100/120 accomplishment messaging in one standalone shared component so dashboard and later goal surfaces cannot drift.
- [Phase 04-dashboard-and-motivational-ux]: Make the dashboard page a thin composition layer over GoalPlanningStore signals and the pure presenter.
- [Phase 04-dashboard-and-motivational-ux]: Ship the frontend through AppShellComponent and redirect the shell root to dashboard instead of keeping HomePage as the default entry.
- [Phase 04-dashboard-and-motivational-ux]: Use Angular CDK focus primitives for the mobile drawer so focus capture and focus return stay accessible without custom trap logic.
- [Phase 04-dashboard-and-motivational-ux]: Reserve /goals/active ahead of :goalId with an intentional lightweight page until Plan 04-03 implements the fuller active-goals surface.
- [Phase 04-dashboard-and-motivational-ux]: Keep Active goals as a route-driven scan page backed by existing GoalPlanningStore state instead of adding inline controls or a separate store in this plan.
- [Phase 04-dashboard-and-motivational-ux]: Use AccomplishmentBandComponent directly in goal detail so dashboard and detail cannot drift on motivational threshold copy.

## Session

- **Stopped at:** Completed 04-03-PLAN.md
- **Last summary:** `.planning/phases/04-dashboard-and-motivational-ux/04-03-SUMMARY.md`

## Notes

- Treat the current repository as a scaffolded brownfield, not an already-working application
- Authentication is explicitly deferred until after the first release
- Template leftovers remain in some docs and metadata and should stay visible during implementation decisions
