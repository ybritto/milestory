# STATE.md

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-04-03)

**Core value:** Milestory must make yearly goals feel concrete, measurable, and motivating by showing clear progress against a plan the user can actually follow.
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — dashboard-and-motivational-ux

## Current Status

- Project initialized for Milestory
- Codebase map exists in `.planning/codebase/`
- Research synthesized in `.planning/research/`
- Requirements and roadmap created for the auth-free personal first release
- Phase 01 is complete with the auth-free backend status endpoint and the Milestory-branded frontend home screen
- Phase 03 is now complete with persistent progress-entry writes, enriched read models, and the goal-detail progress-entry experience
- Next planned work is Phase 04: dashboard and motivational UX planning

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Foundation And Personal Mode | Complete |
| 2 | Goal Planning And Checkpoints | Complete |
| 3 | Progress Engine And Status | Complete |
| 4 | Dashboard And Motivational UX | Pending |

## Current Execution

- **Current phase:** 4
- **Completed plans:** `01-01`, `01-02`, `01-03`, `02-01`, `02-02`, `02-03`, `03-01`, `03-02`, `03-03`
- **Next plan:** `Pending Phase 04 planning`
- **Plan progress:** `3 / 3` (`100%`) for Phase 03

## Decisions

- Keep status assembly in a Spring-free use case and map generated DTOs only at the infrastructure edge.
- Use Spring Boot 4's explicit `spring-boot-liquibase` module so Liquibase baselines apply at runtime.
- Read the live database name from the datasource connection for truthful status reporting.
- Use same-origin generated API configuration so the frontend calls `/api/v1/status` directly without auth plumbing.
- Represent foundation status as explicit loading, ready, empty, and error signal states behind a dedicated frontend store.
- Keep the Phase 1 frontend to a single read-only Milestory home route with no auth or speculative feature scaffolding.
- Reserve dedicated archive and restore endpoints early so the goal lifecycle is contract-backed before controller implementation.
- Keep checkpoint previews cumulative and evenly paced across the planning year so every category shares one backend-owned planning model.
- Surface `GENERIC_FALLBACK` explicitly when category-specific planning logic is absent so later UX can explain that the user should refine the plan.
- Keep generated OpenAPI models at the controller boundary and translate them into application commands through MapStruct.
- Enforce archived goals as read-only backend state, with explicit `KEEP_EXISTING` and `REGENERATE` restore semantics.
- Preserve `BigDecimal` scale through the goal model so equality-based tests and serialized payloads stay stable.
- Reuse the same guided create/edit flow in the frontend so goal updates stay aligned with initial planning.
- Keep the frontend planning store backend-driven so preview, detail, archive, and restore state all come straight from API responses.
- Route `/goals/archive` ahead of the generic detail route so archive navigation cannot be captured by `:goalId`.
- [Phase 03]: Keep progress updates append-only and cumulative, with correction detection based on the latest entry by entryDate then recordedAt.
- [Phase 03]: Derive pace status from checkpoint interpolation on the backend with a named 5 percent of target tolerance constant.
- [Phase 03]: Keep user-facing pace summary and detail strings in the backend service so later UI work renders product-owned copy instead of recomputing tone.
- [Phase 03]: Keep progress updates append-only and cumulative, with correction detection based on the latest entry by entryDate then recordedAt.
- [Phase 03-progress-engine-and-status]: Assemble goal detail and list responses from application read models that pair persisted entries with backend-derived progress snapshots.
- [Phase 03-progress-engine-and-status]: Keep checkpoint context labels and detail copy backend-owned so the frontend renders annotations without rebuilding progress logic.
- [Phase 03]: Keep progress-entry success and correction messaging in the shared planning store so the detail route only renders backend outcome state.
- [Phase 03]: Use an in-route reactive-form overlay with explicit keyboard handling instead of route navigation or a dependency-heavy dialog library.

## Session

- **Stopped at:** Completed 03-03-PLAN.md
- **Last summary:** `.planning/phases/03-progress-engine-and-status/03-03-SUMMARY.md`

## Notes

- Treat the current repository as a scaffolded brownfield, not an already-working application
- Authentication is explicitly deferred until after the first release
- Template leftovers remain in some docs and metadata and should stay visible during implementation decisions
