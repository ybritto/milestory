  - test: "Run the backend and frontend together, then load `/` in the browser"
    expected: "The home page renders the Milestory three-zone layout and the status card resolves from loading into ready, empty, or error based on the live backend response."
    why_human: "Visual quality, responsive layout, and real browser interaction across the routed shell cannot be proven from static inspection alone."
  - test: "Use the `Refresh status` CTA with the backend both available and unavailable"
    expected: "When the backend is reachable, the status card refreshes with backend-owned facts; when it is unavailable, the error state and retry affordance remain readable and recover correctly."
    why_human: "This requires real end-to-end browser behavior and live service interruption/recovery, which the static and unit-level checks do not cover."

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The API contract is auth-free, narrow, and foundation-oriented. | ✓ VERIFIED | [`milestory-api/rest/api-v1.yaml`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-api/rest/api-v1.yaml#L1) exposes only `/api/v1/status`; [`milestory-api/rest/paths/status.yaml`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-api/rest/paths/status.yaml#L1) defines one tagged `GET`; [`milestory-api/rest/schemas/status.yaml`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-api/rest/schemas/status.yaml#L1) defines the ready/empty/degraded response schema. |
| 2 | The repository and generated client are framed as Milestory Phase 1 rather than generic template/auth-first scaffolding. | ✓ VERIFIED | [`README.md`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/README.md#L1) is Milestory-specific and Phase 1 scoped; [`milestory-backend/src/main/resources/openapi-processor-mapping.yaml`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-backend/src/main/resources/openapi-processor-mapping.yaml#L1) keeps generated models under `com.ybritto.milestory.generated`; [`milestory-frontend/package.json`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-frontend/package.json#L1) keeps the `client-gen` path pointed at `../milestory-api/rest/api-v1.yaml`. |
| 3 | Backend package structure separates domain, application, and infrastructure concerns, and status assembly is backend-owned. | ✓ VERIFIED | [`FoundationStatus`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-backend/src/main/java/com/ybritto/milestory/domain/status/FoundationStatus.java#L1) is Spring-free; [`GetFoundationStatusUseCase`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-backend/src/main/java/com/ybritto/milestory/application/status/GetFoundationStatusUseCase.java#L10) assembles the projection; [`SystemFoundationStatusService`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-backend/src/main/java/com/ybritto/milestory/infrastructure/status/SystemFoundationStatusService.java#L11) supplies runtime facts; [`FoundationStatusController`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-backend/src/main/java/com/ybritto/milestory/infrastructure/api/FoundationStatusController.java#L14) only maps to generated transport types. |
| 4 | Liquibase migrations exist and the backend is wired to boot against the configured baseline. | ✓ VERIFIED | [`application.yaml`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-backend/src/main/resources/application.yaml#L19) points Spring Liquibase at [`db.changelog-master.yaml`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-backend/src/main/resources/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml#L1), which includes [`001-foundation-baseline.yaml`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-backend/src/main/resources/db/changelog/changes/001-foundation-baseline.yaml#L1); targeted Maven tests passed with exit code `0`. |
| 5 | The backend exposes `/api/v1/status` anonymously and returns backend-owned status facts. | ✓ VERIFIED | [`FoundationStatusController`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-backend/src/main/java/com/ybritto/milestory/infrastructure/api/FoundationStatusController.java#L15) implements the generated API and delegates to the use case; [`PersonalModeStatusIntegrationTest`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-backend/src/test/java/com/ybritto/milestory/infrastructure/api/PersonalModeStatusIntegrationTest.java#L42) verifies `GET /api/v1/status` returns `200` without auth headers. |
| 6 | The frontend presents a Milestory-branded home screen that loads backend status via the generated client with no auth UI or bearer handling. | ✓ VERIFIED | [`app.config.ts`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-frontend/src/app/app.config.ts#L1) wires `provideHttpClient`, router, and `provideApi('')`; [`foundation-status.store.ts`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-frontend/src/app/core/status/foundation-status.store.ts#L15) calls generated [`FoundationStatusService`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-frontend/src/api/api/foundationStatus.service.ts#L28); [`home.page.html`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-frontend/src/app/features/home/home.page.html#L1) renders loading/ready/empty/error states; targeted Angular tests passed with 8/8 tests green. |

**Score:** 6/6 truths verified

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PLAT-01` | `01-01`, `01-02`, `01-03` | User can use the application in personal single-user mode without authentication | ✓ SATISFIED | Auth-free contract at [`api-v1.yaml`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-api/rest/api-v1.yaml#L1), anonymous backend endpoint proven by [`PersonalModeStatusIntegrationTest`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-backend/src/test/java/com/ybritto/milestory/infrastructure/api/PersonalModeStatusIntegrationTest.java#L42), and frontend app/store contain no auth UI or bearer handling in app code. |
| `PLAT-02` | `01-02`, `01-03` | User can rely on backend-owned domain logic for planning, progress, and dashboard status calculations | ✓ SATISFIED | Domain/application/infrastructure split is present in backend status packages, [`GetFoundationStatusUseCase`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-backend/src/main/java/com/ybritto/milestory/application/status/GetFoundationStatusUseCase.java#L10) owns mode/headline/summary assembly, [`DomainIsolationTest`](/Users/ybritto/dev/Personal/Milestory/milestory-backend/src/test/java/com/ybritto/milestory/architecture/DomainIsolationTest.java#L17) guards domain isolation, and the frontend store/home page only render backend-provided facts. |

No orphaned Phase 1 requirements were found in `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`; the phase maps only `PLAT-01` and `PLAT-02`, and both are claimed by the phase plans.

### Anti-Patterns Found

No blocking anti-patterns remain. The earlier README command drift was corrected on 2026-04-04 by replacing `./mvnw` references with `mvn`.

### Human Verification

### 1. Browser Home Screen

**Test:** Run the backend and frontend together, then load `/` in a browser.
**Expected:** The page shows the Milestory three-zone layout, readable typography, and a status card that moves out of loading based on the live backend response.
**Why human:** Layout quality, responsive behavior, and polished visual presentation are not provable from source inspection or unit tests.
**Result:** Approved by user on 2026-04-04.

### 2. Refresh and Failure Recovery

**Test:** Click `Refresh status` with the backend available, then repeat with the backend stopped or unreachable.
**Expected:** The ready/empty state refreshes from live backend data when available; when unavailable, the error state appears with a readable retry path and recovers after the backend returns.
**Why human:** This requires real browser interaction and live service failure/recovery, which the current automated checks do not simulate end-to-end.
**Result:** Approved by user on 2026-04-04.

### Gaps Summary

No implementation gaps blocking the Phase 1 goal were found in code or targeted tests. The README command drift noted during the initial verification has since been corrected, and the remaining human verification items were approved by the user. Phase 1 therefore closes as `passed` rather than `human_needed`.
